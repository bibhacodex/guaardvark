"""Written-to-spoken text layer for training narration.

Procedure guides are authored the way a specification is written — fractions,
part callouts, code citations. This module turns that into speakable text.

What lives here is the machinery that is true of any trade: numbers, fractions,
measurements, pitches, regulatory citations. What does NOT live here is any
particular trade's vocabulary; a project supplies that through
``Project.terms`` and ``Project.spelled_acronyms``.

The narrator backend is Chatterbox, which has no inline phoneme syntax. The
only control surfaces are respelling and letter-spacing, so every deviation
from the written form is a table entry rather than script-level workaround.
On-screen card text always keeps the written spelling.

Verify every table addition with ``produce.py voicetest``, which whisper-
transcribes each synthesized line and reports what was actually heard.
