"""The customer-project contract for the training-video engine.

The engine is generic: it turns structured procedure guides into narrated video.
Everything that makes the output belong to a particular company — palette,
series wording, trade vocabulary, the narrator's reference clip, and the guides
themselves — lives in that company's own repository and arrives through here.

A project directory contains::

    project.py      defines PROJECT = Project(...)
    guides/         one module per guide, each exposing SCRIPT

and is selected with the ``TD_PROJECT`` environment variable or ``--project``.
With neither, the engine runs unbranded, which is only useful for smoke tests.
