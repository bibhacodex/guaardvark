"""Cross-encoder reranking for retrieval results.

The fused retriever scores a query and a passage independently (bi-encoder plus
BM25); a cross-encoder reads the pair together and is markedly better at deciding
relevance. It is applied to the candidate pool AFTER filtering and dedup, and
BEFORE MMR -- rerank decides what is relevant, MMR decides what is diverse.

The model competes for VRAM with image and video generation, so loading is
admitted against free VRAM and falls back to CPU rather than failing a query.
Every outcome is reported back to the caller for the retrieval trace: a rerank
that did not happen must never look like one that did.

Residency is reclaimable. `unload()` releases the weights and the orchestrator
calls it -- both from its periodic registry (via `status()`) and directly when a
render needs the card. Without that, a query that happened to run while the card
was quiet would take ~1.1 GB of VRAM for the life of the process and starve every
image batch behind it; that is exactly what F-RAG-10 was.
