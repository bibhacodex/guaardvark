"""
Servo Knowledge Store — Two-tiered motor memory for vision-based clicking.

Tier 1 (Reflexes): Calibration constants embedded in this file. Fast, no lookup.
    Updated by the self-improvement engine when it discovers better values.
    Uncle Claude reviews all changes before they go live.

Tier 2 (Archives): Universal interaction history in JSONL. Mined by the
    self-improvement engine to discover patterns and promote them to Tier 1.

The self-improvement loop:
    1. Servo clicks → raw data saved to archives (Tier 2)
    2. Self-improvement engine analyzes archives
    3. Discovers patterns (e.g., "model X returns coords 20% too low")
    4. Proposes code change to promote pattern into reflexes (Tier 1)
    5. Uncle Claude reviews
    6. If approved → reflex updated → next click is better → cycle continues
