"""Who may run a tool that insists on a human answer.

Some tools (MCP tools the server policy gates) must not run unless a person
said yes. In the streaming chat that answer comes from the approval card
(``chat:tool_approval_request``), after which the tool loop runs the call
inside ``trusted_caller("chat_approval")``. A person driving a tool directly
(the Tools page) is trusted the same way. Every other path, such as sync chat,
the agent executor, Celery or the screen loop, has no one to ask, so those
tools refuse there with ``approval_required_message``.

The mark is thread-local: it covers only calls made on the thread that set it.
