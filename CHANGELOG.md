# Changelog

## 2.9.1 — Local-only chat, feedback that teaches, and a start that works offline

- **Chat is local-only again.** The dormant Mistral cloud provider, the `cloud_models_enabled`
  switch behind it and the `/api/llm/*` endpoints are removed. The switch was off by default and
  no page rendered it, but the routes were live and unauthenticated, so an install with
  `MISTRAL_API_KEY` in its environment could be pointed at Mistral by any client that reached the
  API. Local Mistral-family models served by Ollama are unaffected. Hosted models reach Guaardvark
  through the MCP server or the opt-in Uncle Claude escalation, neither of which changes chat routing.
- **`./start.sh` starts offline.** A requirements or lockfile change since the last install no
  longer makes a working environment count as broken: with no route to the package index the
  backend starts on the installed packages, and the frontend keeps its `node_modules` instead of
  letting `npm ci` delete them. The next start with a connection applies the update.
  `GUAARDVARK_OFFLINE=1` forces the offline path.
- **Faster launches when nothing changed.** Python bytecode is cleared and the frontend rebuilt
  only when a fingerprint of the checkout (commit, uncommitted edits, untracked sources, lockfile,
  build-time `VITE_*` env) changed since the last launch; `./start.sh --clean` forces both. The
  clear no longer reaches environments named `venv-*` or `.venv`, so Audio Foundry's music
  environment keeps its library bytecode between launches.
- **Thumbs teach, and can be taken back.** Every assistant reply records its provenance (request
  id, tier, model, persona rule, the memories and retrieval sources its prompt used, the recipe a
  screen task ran, tools). A thumb names its reply by message id; it adjusts the confidence of
  those memories, counts against the recipe, and records corrections and lessons; a second click
  withdraws the verdict and reverses what it taught. The caption under the reply says what it
  taught. Tool cards carry their own thumbs.
- **Any model can drive the screen.** One resolver answers what a model can do by asking Ollama,
  not by matching names (10 of the 23 models on the reference box had at least one detector wrong).
  The user's active model is the brain; when it cannot see, the resolver lends the most accurate
  measured eye. Each eye's axis order is measured on a known board instead of assumed, calibration
  and accuracy live in one store, and eyes are ranked by measured accuracy. A correction loop,
  armed only when the eye's measured accuracy is coarser than the target, re-checks the estimate
  with a marker before clicking. Offline benchmarking, truth-labelled frame capture and a
  calibration page back the measurements.
- **Agent desktop.** Firefox launches on the virtual display with the snap build and its private
  bus; the floating card is square and chat bubbles have a half-opaque background.
- **Dependencies.** beautifulsoup4 4.15.0, Flask-Migrate 4.1.0, mss >= 10.2.0, anthropic >= 1.7.0,
  lucide-react 1.47.0.

- **ComfyUI and the GPU, seven truths.** The plugin's health probe proves the process on :8188 is
  ours (a stranger's ComfyUI on the port used to read as "running" while every Wan batch failed).
  Image-batch bookings release through their generator and a video render books the model's
  VRAM estimate and waits for it before queuing, instead of loading with 1 GB usable and 9.6 GB
  offloaded. The ComfyUI VRAM reserve is declared per model in the registry (MiniMax H3 5.0 GB,
  Wan 2.2 14B 1.0 GB, both measured 2026-09-12); the first render of the other family after a
  launch restarts ComfyUI once with the right reserve, and an explicit
  `GUAARDVARK_COMFYUI_RESERVE_VRAM` still wins. The plugin start re-reads the
  `GUAARDVARK_COMFYUI_*` keys from `.env` every time, so a reserve or attention change needs a
  plugin restart, not a backend restart. A chosen canvas under 1024 on a text-intent prompt is
  kept and batch metadata records the file's real size. A stop/start cycle brings the ComfyUI
  plugin back the way it was. The dead-probe limit is a named constant with its reason.
- **RAG: the index tells the truth.** The unified index manager loads onto the configured pgvector
  store or refuses, never a fresh empty index over the real one. Repository "architectural
  summaries" come only from the model: the old import target was an empty stub, so every summary
  indexed to date was a template; a repository whose model call fails is marked pending, not
  summarised. Purges report a count and a reason; `list_documents` reports an unavailable count
  instead of the page length. The context expander is project-scoped. `read_logs` over MCP scrubs
  machine paths from log lines. (Two audit items were already fixed and are now pinned by tests.)
- **Attachments are answered, not dropped.** A chat attachment over the declared
  `CHAT_ATTACHMENT_MAX_BYTES` (16 MB) gets HTTP 413 or a `chat:error` instead of vanishing at the
  socket buffer; `GET /api/chat/config` reports the limit; the chat page downscales photos before
  sending (longest edge 2048, JPEG 0.9) and shows the size.
- **A self-improvement scan can be cancelled.** `POST /api/self-improvement/scans/<id>/cancel`,
  a `cancelled` status the worker honours at its checkpoints, and a Cancel button that waits for
  it.
- **Building a plugin manager no longer builds a second one.** The status snapshot emitter used
  the process singleton, so any privately constructed manager (a test, a tool) spawned a real-
  registry manager that probed every install port and ran orphan cleanup; one such run under
  pytest took down this checkout's ComfyUI. The emitter now uses the manager that broadcasts, and
  the port-kill path refuses to run under a test.
- **Docs.** HARDWARE.md and INSTALL.md say the same thing about Apple Silicon (stills and LoRA
  training verified; ComfyUI video on Metal has no evidence on file); `--fast` is documented as
  what it gates.
- **Chat asks before it uses a face.** Putting an attached photo's person into a new scene
  (`generate_identity`) now pauses on a consent card: approving records consent next to the photo
  (and under `outputs/consent/` by content hash, so the same image does not ask again), declining
  ends the turn with a refusal and no render. The chat intercepts no longer grant consent on the
  user's behalf, and MCP or CLI callers need a recorded consent for the reference image.
- **Code questions search the code before they read the docs.** When a question mentions the
  source and `search_codebase` is available, the first prompt carries the code tools and holds the
  knowledge-base passages back; they are added, labelled secondary, once a code search has run or
  returned nothing. Other questions are unchanged.
- **The answer says when it was assembled from tool results.** A reply produced after the tool
  budget ran out carries an "Assembled from tool results" chip and its own step row.
- **`guaardvark mcp serve`.** The pip-installed CLI can start the MCP server (stdio, or `--http`)
  from the checkout it finds; with no checkout it says what it looked for. The README's PyPI
  paragraph now says what the package does, the package carries keywords, and the README ends with
  the MCP Registry ownership marker.
- **The identity tool is on by default.** `generate_identity`, its `/identity` command and the PuLID
  pack row no longer wait behind `GUAARDVARK_IDENTITY_TOOL=1`; the consent card and the recorded
  consent are the gate. (Operator-approved 2026-09-19.)
- **Identity renders keep the face again.** PuLID on FLUX had been contributing nothing: the
  pinned node stored its face embedding on the model and deleted it in the node's `__del__`,
  which current ComfyUI fires before the sampler runs, so every render silently ignored the
  reference at any weight. The shipped patch (`plugins/comfyui/custom_nodes.patches/`) moves the
  data onto the cloned patcher's `transformer_options`, where the forward reads it on every step.
  Measured on a synthetic reference (late sixties, white hair, full grey beard): before the fix,
  weights 1.0, 1.5 and 5.0 gave the same clean-shaven man in his thirties; after it, the default
  (fp8, weight 1.0, start 0) renders the reference's hair, beard, age and eyes.
  `generate_with_identity` also takes `weight`, `start_at`, `end_at` and the UNET dtype, and
  `scripts/experiments/pulid_matrix.py` renders a likeness matrix through the product path.
- **Small truths.** The maintenance handler's progress-job cleanup runs the real script instead of
  importing a function that never existed; folder create, upload and document copy answer HTTP 201
  with a message instead of 200 with `"message": 201`; a Setting's repr redacts secret values; a
  chat attachment is served at `/api/outputs/edit_inputs/<name>` so the consent card can show it.
- **The server tells the truth about what it did.** Deleting one image or video batch now removes
  its document, folder and job-history rows and vectors, not just its folder. Starting a service
  plugin whose process died no longer answers "already running": the manager probes the health
  endpoint first and starts it. The Plugins page shows the code-search plugin as running when it
  runs (it answers `/healthz`, not `/health`). `list_documents` over MCP no longer counts RAPTOR
  summary nodes as documents. The progress-job cleanup script that three callers invoked, and the
  health check reported missing, now exists (dry run by default, `--execute` to clean).
- **A chat turn that runs out of tool iterations answers from what it found.** The engine makes one
  more call with tools off and marks the reply `synthesized` instead of emitting an empty response.
- **Credentials stay out of the log.** A failed read or write of a `*_key`, `*_token`, `*_secret` or
  password setting logs the exception type only; SQLAlchemy would otherwise print the bound value.
- **File Manager copies files and folders.** New `POST /api/files/folder/<id>/copy` deep-copies a
  folder into a target (or the root) with `(Copy)` naming; the context-menu actions use it.
- **Settings and Images page say what they do.** Slash commands defined as rules load again (the
  rules endpoint returns a bare array). On Z-Image and Krea 2 Turbo the negative prompt and
  "enhance anatomy" controls are disabled with a note, since those models ignore them, and the
  auto preset's caption says it stuffs quality tags rather than detecting settings. RAG debug shows
  the performance metrics it fetched; LoRA strength saves on blur or Enter; the scan dialog can be
  closed with the scan continuing; the memory merge target is picked from a list, not a prompt.
- **Tests.** `run_tests.py` runs the whole suite by default (4,077 tests) with `--quick` for the old
  filter, and its migration check points at the script that exists. `backend/mcp/tests` collects
  from both the repo root and `backend/`. Twenty-one September test files that had never been run
  now pass; the image generator exposes `get_status()` with the GPU fault the API reports.
- **Web pages are read at the passage the question is about.** `fetch_url` and `analyze_website`
  take an optional `query`; with it, the 2,000-character excerpt is the stretch of the page that
  holds the most of the question's terms (`backend/utils/text_focus.py`) instead of the top of the
  page, which on most sites is the navigation. On the Wikipedia page for the aardvark, "what does
  an aardvark eat" used to return the language menu; it now returns the feeding passage. Without a
  query nothing changes.
- **Chat edits photos: Qwen-Image-Edit, inpaint, outpaint, background removal, and a face
  carried into a new scene.** With a picture attached, chat has `edit_image` (prefers
  Qwen-Image-Edit 2509 FP8 when installed, then FLUX.1 Kontext, then img2img), `inpaint_image`,
  `outpaint_image` (grows the canvas and fills it) and `remove_background` (an alpha cut-out),
  plus `/inpaint`, `/outpaint` and `/removebg`. Plain phrasings route on their own ("remove the
  background", "extend the picture to the left"); "put a hat on this person" stays an edit.
  `generate_identity` (PuLID on FLUX.1-dev: one face photo, a new scene) is built but off by
  default: on the reference 16 GB card it returned a younger, dark-haired man for a grey-bearded
  reference at identity weights 1.0 and 1.5, so it waits behind `GUAARDVARK_IDENTITY_TOOL=1`
  until the likeness is right. Everything they need installs from **Manage Image Models →
  Image editing**: one table declares which pack each tool needs, the modal lists the packs with
  per-row Install and Install all, and a tool without its pack answers one sentence naming that
  modal. Nothing downloads on its own: the PuLID pack now carries the EVA02-CLIP and facexlib
  files its ComfyUI node used to fetch at first use (the plugin patches the pinned node so it
  runs on ComfyUI 0.33; its pack is listed only with the flag), and background removal runs the rembg project's u2net / BiRefNet ONNX
  files through the onnxruntime already shipped, without the rembg package. Measured on a 16 GB
  card: a 20-step Qwen edit in 108 s (ComfyUI keeps 11.2 GB of the FP8 weights resident and
  offloads 8.2 GB), a PuLID render in 28 s, a u2net cut-out in 1 s on CPU; the registry's VRAM
  estimates are those measurements, since the earlier 14 GB guess plus admission headroom
  refused every edit on that card. Model entries: `qwen-image-edit`, `qwen-image-clip`,
  `qwen-image-vae`, `pulid-flux`, `pulid-antelopev2`, `eva02-clip`, `facexlib-face`,
  `bgremove-birefnet`, `bgremove-u2net`. A finished image download is no longer re-announced
  each time the Image Models modal opens after a restart.
- **Add new model is a declared family table, and the server checks the paste.** Which
  architectures a Hugging Face paste can join is now one table (`user_model_families.py`)
  shared by the Image and Video Add dialogs: Z-Image, Krea 2, SDXL, SD 1.5 and FLUX stills for
  images (FLUX UNETs and SDXL/FLUX LoRAs install into ComfyUI), Wan, MiniMax, LTX, Hunyuan and
  CogVideoX for video. A repo the product cannot load (Qwen-Image, SD3, HiDream) is refused by
  name instead of being filed under SDXL. Look-up reads the licence, gated state, pipeline tag
  and `model_index.json` class; `hf.co` and `refs/pr/N` revisions parse; dataset and Space
  URLs are refused. Registering re-inspects the repo on the server (the client's
  `has_model_index` and file list are no longer trusted, and a file path cannot leave the
  repo), the same repo and files twice answers 409 with the existing id, and a catalog add
  succeeds even when the Install could not start. Image installs gained the video downloader's
  behaviour: persisted status, stall detection that keeps its lock, progress from the real
  destination folder, already-installed short-circuit. The dialogs share one look-up hook,
  clear a stale preview when the paste changes, use a radio for a single file, offer a filter
  for long file lists, show name, family, size and licence before Install, and can add without
  installing. Remove asks whether to delete the files on both modals; Batch Image has Manage
  models.
- **Audio Studio has a Manage models modal, and Generate never downloads weights.** Audio
  Studio's first Generate used to fetch weights from Hugging Face on its own (ACE-Step 8 GB,
  the gated Stable Audio Open). Weights now install only from Audio Studio → Manage models
  (voice, music, FX rows with sizes, per-row Install and Install all missing; the plugin can be
  started from there), listed and downloaded by the backend so the modal works with the sidecar
  stopped. The loaders refuse a cache miss and name the modal instead of downloading.
  Installs fetch only the files the loaders read: Chatterbox is five files (3.3 GB) out of a
  13.9 GB repo, Stable Audio Open skips its duplicate root checkpoints (5.3 GB of 15.7). MiniMax
  Music 3 keeps installing into ComfyUI through the same button. Routes:
  `GET /api/audio-foundry/models`, `POST .../models/download`, `GET .../models/download-status`.

## 2.9.0 — Agent skills, a Claude Code plugin, and MiniMax H3 at its ceiling

229 commits since 2.8.1. A coding agent can drive Guaardvark through fifteen Agent Skills, a
Claude Code plugin installable from this repository, and an MCP server that behaves the way its
tools are described. MiniMax H3 is wired through the product, users can add their own Hugging
Face models, and the Settings page, chat defaults and retrieval were rebuilt or fixed.
**No database migration.** Python and frontend dependencies changed; the next `./start.sh` sees
the edited requirement files and reinstalls, and the frontend installs from its lockfile.
Interconnector clients: Update Now, restart, and rebuild the frontend bundle.

- **Wan 2.2 14B no longer renders black rectangles under ComfyUI's ck attention.** ComfyUI's ck
  (Comfy Kitchen INT8) attention left NaN patch tokens in Wan 2.2 14B image-to-video latents,
  which decode as black rectangles: 6 of 9 Lightning renders at 960x544 with the same seed. The
  same graphs with PyTorch attention had no NaN. The Wan 14B registry entries now declare
  `attention: "pytorch"`, and the graph adds a `ModelAttentionBackend` after the LoRAs when
  `GUAARDVARK_COMFYUI_ATTENTION` asks for ck, sage or auto and ComfyUI offers the node; a default
  launch builds the same graph as before. MiniMax H3, where ck was measured faster with identical
  frames, keeps it. A failed `/object_info` fetch is no longer cached, so a ComfyUI stopped for
  another GPU job no longer reads as every node missing until the backend restarts.
- **Adjust & Retry keeps the speed profile; a profile's LoRAs are not free adapters.** A batch
  saved its step count but not its speed profile, so reloading a 4-step Lightning batch came back
  as Standard at 4 steps, and the reload counted those steps as typed, which bypassed Wan's
  20-step floor. Batches now save `speed_profile` and `style_embedding`, and the reload keeps the
  stored steps only when `steps_explicit` says a person typed them. The Video Gen page no longer
  lists a speed profile's LoRAs as adapters, and the backend refuses them with a message naming
  the profile (`speed_profile_loras` in the registry). Tests: `backend/tests/services/test_wan_speed_profiles.py`.
- **MCP tools that need the backend reach it over HTTP.** The MCP server has no Flask app, so any
  tool that touched `db.session`, `current_app` or `flask.request` failed with "Working outside of
  application context". Those tools now hand their work to the running backend
  (`backend/utils/backend_http.py`, `POST /api/tools/execute`, two new GET routes for the
  repository map and dependency graph); Film Crew, music video, bulk CSV, video and animation run
  in the backend process, and `backend.app` refuses to import inside the MCP server.
- **The MCP adapter behaves the way its tools are described.** Guard state is per client session;
  an identical call is refused only while the first is still running, and a tool that keeps
  failing pauses for 60 s instead of staying blocked. Every tool declares read-only (and
  destructive where it can discard something), published schemas carry defaults, enums and
  bounds and arguments are validated before a tool runs, a state-changing call accepts an
  `idempotency_key`, `resources/list` pages with a cursor, the `/outputs/<path>` download route
  registers again, and `doctor --call` makes one real read-only call per tool family.
- **Verbatim prompts shows what the server saved.** The Settings toggle flipped before the save
  and swallowed a failure; it now disables itself while saving, takes `enabled` and
  `forced_by_env` from the response, and reports a failed save.
- **Bring your own Hugging Face models.** Manage Video Models adds a model, LoRA or text encoder
  from a pasted Hugging Face URL, a text encoder can be picked per generation, and user LoRAs and
  encoders work on LTX and Hunyuan as well as Wan and MiniMax. The Images page adds Hugging Face
  image models and LoRAs the same way.
- **Settings.** The page was rebuilt around what each control does, five settings that reported
  the wrong state were fixed, the Rules page filters learned rules, each retrieval profile has an
  editor, and the Workspaces navigation choice writes the value the layout checks for.
- **Ollama.** Only what `start.sh` started is stopped (`--keep-ollama`, `--all`,
  `--external-ollama`, with matching Settings switches), and every request carries a context size
  instead of inheriting the chat model's Modelfile window.
- **Chat.** A host can hand the engine its conversation and hooks, so an embedded assistant runs
  the engine's tool loop; Floating Chat messages have a copy-text icon.
- **Video fixes.** The H3 Turbo 4-step profile no longer refuses the default canvas, the
  effective-settings chip names the model that will run, the end-frame control says what it does,
  and a failed task shows its reason instead of sitting at 0 %.
- **macOS.** AppleDouble sidecar files are stripped, the LoRA venv is created, the backend
  defaults to port 5055 away from AirPlay Receiver, pgvector builds from source when Homebrew's
  formula skips the running Postgres major, and Stable Audio Open may try Apple Silicon when
  opted in.
- **Interconnector.** `frontend/public`, `VERSION` and `celery_beat_gates.py` now reach clients,
  with the allowlist guard running in CI.
- **Dependencies.** OpenCV is locked to 4.11.0.86 across its three distributions (the last line
  that accepts numpy 1.x; numpy stays on 1.x) and the unused CV stack is gone; Vite 8, Vitest 5,
  react-grid-layout 2 and zustand 5 on the frontend; `mcp>=2.1.1`, `peft>=0.20.0`,
  `llama-index-vector-stores-postgres>=0.9.0` and `numba` in the backend.

- **MCP calls no longer hang on a busy GPU, and the MCP server no longer renders.** The MCP server is its own process, and `generate_image` used to load a diffusion pipeline inside it, next to the backend's; a failed result then reached the client as `(no output)` because the adapter dropped `ToolResult.error`. Now the adapter tags calls with `transport=mcp`, and `generate_image` in that context hands the prompt to the backend over its HTTP API (queued by default, returning the batch id in ~10 ms; `wait_for_result=true` polls the backend and returns the file), `get_generation_status` reads any image or video batch back with file URLs (idempotent, so polling is not blocked by the duplicate-call guard), and failed results carry their error text. Inside the backend (chat) the inline render is unchanged. The MCP adapter now runs every tool on a worker thread under the configured timeout (default raised from a never-enforced 30 s to an enforced 120 s; 30 min for a call that asked to wait), answers a timeout with a message that the work is still running, and per-tool argument defaults live in `data/config/mcp.json` `server.tools.argument_defaults`. Tests: `backend/mcp/tests/test_smoke.py`, `backend/tests/unit/test_image_tool_queue.py`.
- **AGENT_GUIDE.md.** The operating contract for a coding agent that uses Guaardvark: first-interaction rules, Rule Zero (every job goes through a skill), a mandatory preflight that turns the hardware tier into what this box can do, the announce-before-spend / ask-before-switch / no-silent-downgrade contract, the human checkpoints with the route that releases each, how the tools behave over MCP, prompting rules per model family, a quick lookup, what not to do, and a contributor section. `AGENTS.md` becomes the router that points at it.
- **Claude Code plugin + marketplace.** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` make the repository installable with `/plugin marketplace add guaardvark/guaardvark` and `/plugin install guaardvark@guaardvark`: the skills load as `/guaardvark:<skill>` and the MCP server starts from the checkout path the install asks for.
- **Agent skills pack.** `.agents/skills/` carries fifteen Agent Skills (`setup`, `-image`, `-video`, `-music-video`, `-film-crew`, `-voice`, `-music`, `-upscale`, `-cast`, `-models`, `-swarm`, `-knowledge`, `-code`, `-outreach`, `-ops`), each naming the exact MCP tool or REST route for its flow, so a coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenClaw) can drive a running Guaardvark without guessing endpoints. `python -m backend.mcp install --skills` links them into `~/.claude/skills`; the pack README is `.agents/skills/README.md`.
- **Z-Image gets prompts as prose, never as SD-era tags.** A plain sentence such as
  "a man and woman watching a movie on a couch, her head on his shoulder" was leaving the
  Images page with 22 phrases appended ("full body shot, realistic stance, correct anatomy,
  anatomically correct, ..."), boilerplate written for CLIP-captioned SD 1.5. Z-Image's
  encoder is an LLM and reads those as scene content: on this box the stuffed prompt gave
  posed, camera-facing figures with tangled legs on four of four seeds, while the bare
  sentence or a prose rewrite on the same seeds was clean. The 1,400-character anatomy
  negative was never reaching the model at all (CFG-distilled, guidance 0). Each stills
  family now declares a `prompt_style` in `backend/services/stills_defaults.py`; for
  "natural" families the offline enhancer sends the sentence as written (plus one prose
  clause for a non-photo style), and the default enhance rung becomes the media director's
  new prose contract, a port of the prompt-enhancer template the model's authors ship with
  their demo, which falls back to the exact sentence when no chat model answers. Chat and
  batch share the change; the Images page's prompt preview now resolves "auto" to the
  default model so it shows the policy that actually runs. Krea 2 keeps tags until it is
  measured the same way.
- **The Director asks the active chat model first.** Every Director call (stills rewrite,
  storyboards, edit refinement, video and music video planning) was hard-wired to
  `gemma4:e4b`, then any gemma, then whatever was installed, ignoring the model made active
  on the Settings page. The ladder is now: an explicit per-job model, then the Settings-page
  model, then any installed gemma, then any installed qwen, then the rest, matched anywhere
  in the tag so a custom build such as `someone/Gemma-4-custom` counts. Embedding models
  never qualify. The stills rewrite tries up to three rungs, so a model that errors or hands
  back the wrong number of prompts is skipped rather than silently dropping to the raw
  sentence.
- **The chat can search the code.** `search_codebase` is one tool name for "search this
  project's source": by meaning or by symbol, returning files, line numbers and the code. With
  the new zvec-grep plugin (`plugins/zvec_grep`, off by default, Node 22, CPU, everything on
  the machine) it runs a local vector-plus-keyword index of the checkout; without it, the
  repository's regex search. Questions about the source keep the tool in the prompt and get
  one system line saying the code is already indexed. Measured 2026-09-08 on eight questions
  about this repository with document retrieval off: baseline made no tool calls and
  answered three with hedges; with the tool every question called it and seven came back
  naming the right file and function. Four engine fixes came out of the trial and apply to
  every tool: the result a tool hands back to the model is capped by a budget the tool
  declares (`BaseTool.observation_chars`) instead of a flat 500 characters that left a search
  with a header and no code; a tool call written in signature form
  (`search_codebase(query:string='x')`) is normalised instead of failing as an unknown tool;
  an MCP server's error result is a failure, not output; and the request's `project_root`
  reaches tools that need it. Known: with document retrieval on, the model still prefers the
  documents and rarely reaches for the tool.
- **Thinking is off unless someone asks for it, everywhere the product talks to Ollama.**
  The Chat page's "Chat thinking" setting was documented as off by default while the stored
  value said on, so every reply on this box and on a client's box paid for gemma4's hidden reasoning:
  the same question measured at 1,163 generated tokens and about 40 s for a 554-character
  answer with thinking on, 183 tokens and about 10 s for an 858-character answer with it off.
  Outside the Chat page nothing set the flag at all, and a thinking model given a token cap
  can spend the whole cap reasoning and hand back an empty answer (the agent's narration
  fallback, an 800-token call, did exactly that). One predicate now decides which models
  reason, `model_supports_thinking` in `backend/utils/ollama_resource_manager.py`, by name
  pattern and then by Ollama's own capabilities list, so qwen3 is covered and a family the
  list has not met is still caught. `build_ollama` turns thinking off for those models unless
  the caller passes `thinking` itself; `get_llm_instance(model=...)` accepts `thinking`,
  `request_timeout`, `json_mode`, `num_ctx` and `num_predict` like a white-label build already
  did; the model-switch and startup instances, the brain's capability probe, the diagnostics
  ping and the agent's narration fallback all go through the same helper. The Chat page's
  per-chat `/thinking on` still wins, and the retry after an Ollama serializer crash now keeps
  that choice instead of silently reasoning again. Retrieved context handed to the chat model
  is cut on whitespace (`backend/utils/text_cut.py`): a 500-character slice through "4:12"
  left "4:1" in a prompt and the model repeated it as fact.
- **The same answer-only default for every direct Ollama call.** The film crew's
  screenwriting and consensus calls, the character generator, the video, media and music video
  directors, the animation steering prompt, the video quality review, the H3 prompt polish, the
  outreach persona and grader, the natural-language control plane, the lesson distiller, image
  OCR and the music prompt rewriter each built their own request without a `think` field, so a
  thinking model could spend a 150- or 400-token cap on reasoning and return nothing to parse.
  Every one of them now spreads `think_payload(model)`, which is `{"think": false}` for a model
  that reasons and nothing for any other.
- **Three chat defects seen on camera 2026-09-05.** A thinking model is prompted with
  `[tool_call]` markup, but the stream only held back the angle-bracket form, so the raw
  markup typed into the bubble for a second before the parser consumed it; both forms are
  held back now, and neither reaches saved history. A reply that echoed the tool list
  (`search_knowledge_base(query:string, top_k:int?)...`) was non-empty, so the empty-answer
  retry never fired and the echo became the answer; the turn is now repeated once with
  thinking off and says plainly if the model echoes again. On the legacy agent-loop and
  file-generation paths the page appended a second user bubble after the optimistic one and
  read a `final_answer` that `tool_result` and `file_generation` replies never carry, so a
  finished CSV was reported as "Agent execution completed with no response"; the bubble is
  reused and the server now returns the `display_content` it already persisted.
- **Chat retrieval had been failing on every turn.** The hybrid retriever ran its vector and
  keyword legs through a nested event loop; inside a request thread the first call died with
  "Detected nested async" and every later one with asyncpg's "another operation is in
  progress", so the model answered from memory and told people nothing was indexed while 18
  documents were. The two legs now run in sequence on the store's synchronous engine
  (`use_async=False` in `backend/services/indexing_service.py`); a question about the indexed
  README comes back citing it.
- **One active video model for every pipeline.** Chat `/video`, `videos generate` in the CLI,
  batch requests that omit a model, the music video and Film Crew all pick their model through
  one resolver: an explicit id, else a per-pipeline override, else the global setting at
  `/api/settings/active_video_model`, else the largest installed model the card can hold. An id
  that cannot run is refused in one sentence; families are never swapped silently. Omitted fps,
  frames, steps and canvas fill from the model's declared native values, so the CogVideoX
  low-VRAM path no longer cuts steps below the model's floor. Note: where the music video and
  Film Crew editor used to hard-code Wan 2.2 14B I2V, the default now follows the registry,
  which has been Wan 2.2 5B TI2V since July; pick 14B in the picker or the setting to keep it.
- **Music video and Film Crew start from chat, the CLI and MCP.** "Make a music video from
  song.mp3, neon noir" and "film this script …" create the project and start analysis or the
  screenwriter, then stop at the Studio gate: nothing is approved and no GPU render starts
  outside Studio. A song path or script path given to those tools must sit under the uploads or
  outputs directory or the install root. Frame counts snap to each model's declared grid,
  MiniMax's 17k+5 included.
- **Paths from a request stay inside the directory they belong to.** One helper,
  `backend/utils/path_guard.py`, joins caller-supplied names under a server-chosen root and
  refuses anything that lands outside it; forty call sites (batch video, files, backups,
  outputs, jobs, uploads, the interconnector, the swarm and video-editor sidecars) now go
  through it instead of their own `resolve()`/`startswith` checks. Vector-store table names
  are quoted through psycopg2's `Identifier`, the self-test category is allow-listed before
  it reaches a subprocess, Audio Foundry proxy replies are always JSON, and the system map
  and `/build` accept roots inside the running codebase or the uploads directory only.
  Closes the 280 open code-scanning alerts except the 21 that describe operator-directed
  browsing of the server's own filesystem, which are dismissed with reasons.
- **GPU faults are reported as GPU faults.** A CUDA error that kills the context (launch
  timeout, illegal memory access, device-side assert, uncorrectable ECC and kin) is now
  recognised in one place. The backend records it, refuses further GPU work immediately
  instead of retrying it, fails the rest of a running batch without trying each prompt, and
  tells the user the backend needs a restart. Before this, one driver watchdog reset left
  every later image request failing for hours with "pipeline failed to load — usually VRAM
  pressure or an incomplete download". Status reports the fault under `gpu_fault`.

- **Capability contract.** Every video model entry can declare modes (text, first frame,
  last frame, first+last, reference), audio in and out, whether it samples with CFG, its
  frame rule and rate, clip bounds, a step floor and default, speed profiles, style
  embeddings, reference limits, per-VRAM-class starting settings and its license.
  `model_capabilities()` fills family defaults for older entries; `/api/batch-video/models`
  exposes the record; the Video Generator, `generate_video`, Film Crew and the music video
  pipeline read it instead of testing a family name. The step floor now lives in the
  registry, so API and MCP callers get it too; a value a person typed still wins.
- **MiniMax H3.** Reference build, unpruned Int8 (24GB) and BF16 (48GB) rungs, the three
  turbo LoRAs as optional companions behind speed profiles, ten style embeddings, all six
  aspect ratios, last-frame and first+last-frame modes, image and audio anchors at any
  frame, and the reference graph (9 images, 3 clips, 3 audio files) with references named
  in the prompt in wiring order. A prompt compiler renders Guaardvark's structured intent
  into the model's format (numbered shots with cut times that add up to the clip, speaker
  ids, tagged dialogue in the model card's eleven languages), with an optional polish pass
  by the local director model that is discarded if it touches the dialogue. Eight authored
  prompt presets ship in `plugins/comfyui/scripts/prompt_bundles/minimax_h3`.
- **Film Crew on H3.** A production can name its video model; on a native-audio model each
  scene renders as windows of at most fifteen seconds with the cast's lines spoken by the
  model, joined on the storyboard stills, no voiceover laid over them, the score mixed
  under the window's own soundtrack. Cast reference images go in as references when the
  reference build is installed.
- **Music video on H3.** The clip profile (rate, frame bounds, native audio) comes from the
  registry; on a native-audio model each cut renders in one pass with the song slice
  anchored at frame 0 so the motion follows its beats, the song staying the master track.
- **Chat and MCP.** `generate_video` takes model, aspect ratio, seconds, first and last
  image, references, audio and a speed profile, each checked against the model's record;
  the assistant is told the H3 prompt format on video pages. Publishing adds a
  "Generated with MiniMax H3 on Guaardvark" line to posts that carry H3 clips (opt-out per
  connection) and enforces a per-platform clip-length cap declared in data.
- **ComfyUI launch.** `GUAARDVARK_COMFYUI_ATTENTION=auto|ck|sage|pytorch` selects an
  attention backend (Comfy Kitchen int8 ships in the venv; SageAttention is never
  installed for you); `GUAARDVARK_COMFYUI_RESERVE_VRAM` raises the reserve a partially
  loaded model needs. The plugin restart route no longer fails on a missing attribute.
- **Measured** on a 16 GB RTX 40-series card with 64 GB-class RAM, pruned Int8, 864x480, 124
  frames (5 s), 20 steps, PyTorch attention: 6.5 minutes wall, about 17 s per step, VRAM
  peak 14.5 GB with most of the transformer offloaded, ComfyUI resident memory peak 27 GB;
  the clip was clean. The first attempt ran out of memory at 1 GB of reserve; 3 GB
  finished. Same seed and canvas: the 8-step turbo profile 186 s with the subject,
  motion and background intact and slightly softer fur (now the 16 GB starting
  profile); Comfy Kitchen int8 attention 339 s at 15 s per step with frames
  indistinguishable from PyTorch (opt-in until the other families are compared). On the
  turbo profile the 10 s clip took 237 s and the 15 s clip 372 s, both coherent to the
  end at 480p; those tiers now appear as duration presets. The 1344x768 canvas ran out
  of memory at a 3 GB reserve and rendered at 5 GB (`GUAARDVARK_COMFYUI_RESERVE_VRAM=5.0`):
  171 s on the 4-step 768p profile with the transformer fully offloaded. An audio anchor works as a
  performance track: a 4 s narration anchored at frame 0 came back in the clip's
  soundtrack with a 0.91 waveform correlation (0.99 on the envelope), rendered in 138 s
  on the turbo profile.

### CLI

The `guaardvark` command is now a peer of the web UI, not a subset.

- **One command catalog.** Slash router, tab completion, `/help`, and the contract tests
  share `COMMAND_TREE`. `/imagine`, `/video`, `/voice`, `/ingest`, `/agent`, `/web`,
  `/load`, `/skills`, and `recipes` complete. Unknown commands get “Did you mean…?”.
  Completion works without a leading `/`.
- **Theme-true prompt.** REPL colors follow `/theme` (including `day` and `auto`). Compact
  banner on short terminals so the 30-row aardvark art does not overflow. Chat prefix is
  the brand mark, not a llama. `/clear` uses Rich. Config lives in `~/.guaardvark/cli.json`
  (legacy `~/.llx` still read). `/web` uses the real frontend port from runtime.json.
- **Studio commands.** `plugins`, `gpu`, `mcp`, `audio`, `swarm`, `lessons` wrap the
  existing APIs. `guaardvark completion bash|zsh|fish` prints a shell script.
  `guaardvark doctor --cli` reports terminal graphics / tmux passthrough.
- **Show the artifact.** `/imagine` previews inline (Kitty / iTerm / chafa). `/voice`
  plays locally. `/agent shot` dumps the agent desktop. Jobs notify on complete.

## 2.8.1 — Profiles, extensions, and a bootstrap that converges offline

16 commits since 2.8.0. Two product-shaping features — a profile switch and a client
extension seam — and a set of installer fixes from watching a client box with a flapping
resolver fail to finish bootstrap for an evening. Nothing in this release changes the
database or the knowledge index; upgrading is a pull and a restart.

- `start_postgres.sh` takes the role, database, host and port from `DATABASE_URL` and never
  re-provisions a role it did not create; before this a fork with its own role on the same
  machine had its password reset and its URL rewritten to the stock database. `start.sh` and
  the agent display kill only a port's listener, not a process holding a client socket to it.
  The DSN is logged with its password masked. ComfyUI's liveness probe tolerates ~2 minutes of
  silence while a 20 GB+ model loads on a 16 GB card (measured downstream), instead of 20 s.
- **Profiles.** One switch sets the product shape: `GUAARDVARK_PROFILE=<name>` in `.env` or
  `./start.sh --profile <name>`. `workstation` is today's product and sets nothing;
  `creator` is the media workflow (image, video, audio, Film Crew, LoRA, upscaling) with the
  agent, knowledge-index, outreach and automation subsystems left installed but unlisted and
  off by default; an extension can ship its own. An explicit `.env` value, flag, plugin toggle
  or DB setting always wins over a profile, and hidden means unlisted, never removed. See
  `backend/profiles/README.md`. The sidebar lists what the profile lists, `/` lands where it
  says, Settings → Product Profile switches profiles (applies on restart), and a fresh
  install asks once — Creator or Workstation — before anything else.
- **Extensions.** A client vertical lives in `extensions/<id>/` — blueprints, models, Celery
  tasks, column migrations, seeds, a profile, an optional sidecar plugin — and core loads it
  through fixed hook points without any core file naming it. A broken extension is reported
  by id while the others still load, and a declared URL prefix with no mounted route is an
  error rather than a silent 404. Extensions register handlers for their own task types
  instead of editing the unified task executor. `extensions/_template/` is the starting point;
  see `extensions/README.md`. On the frontend, `extensions/<id>/frontend/index.jsx` contributes
  routes, nav groups, themes, page context, chat surfaces, store state, a header bar and a
  logo; core merges them at build time and imports for the extension resolve through core's
  dependencies and the `@` alias.
- Settings → Maintenance gains **Delete History**, next to Clear Cache: removes every
  batch-image, batch-video and audio generation — the media directories and files, their
  `documents`/`folders` rows and `job_history` entries — and logs each purge to
  `retention_audit`. Batches still generating are skipped. Film Crew productions, video
  editor projects, the cast library and LoRAs, and chat history are not touched. The audio
  sidecar gains `DELETE /jobs` so its in-memory job list and its `.jobs` files stay in step.
- **Bootstrap converges offline.** Every step that contacted a package index even when
  nothing needed to change is gone or gated: `install_pytorch.sh` probes the venv first
  and skips the 3 GB torch re-stage when the exact build is already installed
  (`GUAARDVARK_TORCH_FORCE=1` restores always-reinstall); the torch channel comes from the
  hardware policy instead of a second table that disagreed with it (cu121 vs cu124 on
  Ampere/Ada made the reconciler and `start.sh` swap the CUDA stack back and forth); the
  numpy/setuptools re-pin probes offline (`scripts/lib/venv_pins.sh`) and only reinstalls
  a violated spec; the cli reconciler skips when the editable install already points at
  `cli/`; and `system-manager` never creates a venv from a non-3.12 interpreter (Ubuntu
  26.04's `python3` is 3.14, whose venv compiled numpy from source and failed).
- Every bootstrap pip pass runs under `backend/constraints.txt` (`PIP_CONSTRAINT`, operator
  value wins), which now caps `opencv-contrib-python`, `tifffile` and `ml-dtypes` at their
  last numpy<2 lines. Before this the unconstrained CV pass upgraded numpy to 2.x on every
  boot and the torch pass dragged it back, looping through a full torch re-stage each time.
- The CV / face-restoration stack (gfpgan, realesrgan, basicsr, facexlib, controlnet-aux,
  mediapipe — hundreds of MB) is opt-in with `GUAARDVARK_INSTALL_CV=1` instead of
  installing on every GPU box. Both consumers import lazily and degrade when it is absent.
- Two installs on one machine no longer see each other's Celery workers: `start_celery.sh`
  and `start.sh` count a worker only when its working directory is under this checkout,
  the same confinement `stop.sh` already applies. The pgvector step distinguishes a
  missing package from a missing superuser, names the package for the major actually
  serving, and reads the same configured URL as the role and database do.
- **Interconnector sync ships every `backend/` package.** The sync allowlist named
  `backend/` packages one by one, so `backend/profiles` and `backend/extensions` never
  reached a client while the synced `config.py` / `app.py` already imported them — every
  client boot after Update Now died with `cannot import name 'extensions' from 'backend'`.
  The nine missing entries are listed and a test walks the real `backend/` directory so
  the next new package fails in CI, not on a client.
- The PyPI project page shows the README again. `setup.py` read `long_description` from the
  repo root, which the wheel build cannot see; the 2.8.0 wheel published with an empty
  page. The release build now copies `README.md` into `cli/` the way it already does
  `VERSION`.

## 2.8.0 — MiniMax H3, a rebuilt knowledge index, and a cleaner clean install

367 commits since 2.7.0. The largest single change is the knowledge index, which was
rebuilt from the storage layout up and needs one re-index (see the note below). Around
it: three new video model families, an overnight self-improvement director, Discord
through the same chat engine as the UI, a privacy audit of every path that could reach
the network, a platform layer with macOS in CI, and the clean-install bugs a tester
found on a fresh Windows 11 / WSL2 box.

**This release requires a full re-index of your knowledge base.** Existing vectors were
built with different chunking and are not migrated. Nothing is lost — your documents are
the source of truth and are re-read from disk — but plan for the corpus to be
unavailable while it rebuilds. See *Upgrading the knowledge index* below.

### Clean-install fixes

All three were reported against a fresh install on 2026-08-29 and all three were real:

- **Film Crew failed with `model 'gemma4:e4b' not found`.** The installer's hardware
  policy pulls `gemma4:e2b` on most machines; the swarm agents hard-coded `e4b`. A chat
  model name is now a preference resolved against what Ollama actually has — same
  family first, then the saved active model, then the policy's tier model
  (`backend/services/ollama_chat_model.py`).
- **pgvector was never installed.** `start_postgres.sh` provisioned PostgreSQL but not
  the `vector` extension the index stores into, and enabling it needs a superuser the
  app role is not. Provisioning now installs `postgresql-<major>-pgvector` (Homebrew
  `pgvector` on macOS) and runs `CREATE EXTENSION`; existing installs get it on the next
  start, with one sudo prompt.
- **LoRA training stopped at `No module named 'peft'`.** Z-Image training runs in the
  backend venv, which never listed it. It does now.

### Video generation

- **MiniMax H3** — download plan in the video model registry and generation through
  ComfyUI. It fits a 16 GB card at the template's settings; see *Known limitations*
  for the speed caveat.
- **LTX-2.5 distilled** as a local ComfyUI family, with I2V/T2V aligned to the official
  pipeline for identity preservation, a preflight file check, and the audio VAE
  registered where the loader actually looks.
- **HunyuanVideo 13B** T2V/I2V (GGUF Q5_K_M) in the downloader and generator.
- **Wan 2.2** — quality presets can no longer hand Wan a step count it cannot render
  (`minSteps` on the model entry, measured against the smearing that 10 steps produced);
  the 14B's trained sampler shift is fixed at 8.0 by default instead of scaled by pixel
  area; 1:1 is back; a sampler profile toggle for the 5B (adaptive euler or official
  uni_pc); 24 fps presets and a Motion preset that reaches the model; guidance comes
  from the model's own workflow.
- **Live latent preview** while ComfyUI renders.
- Long renders survive: VRAM-wait admission, staged progress, a real start budget for
  the ComfyUI launcher with a loud fallback, and a ComfyUI interrupt scoped to the
  prompts we queued rather than everything in its queue.
- A per-family pixel-area clamp prevents hangs; an unsupported aspect ratio is clamped
  server-side as well as in the UI.
- The chosen model animates its own keyframe; a failed director pass no longer switches
  the prompt enhancer off.
- Video from inline chat (`generate_video` tool), a fullscreen player with prev/next,
  and a VLM temporal-quality reviewer (MiniCPM-V 4.5).

### Images and the media workspace

- One tabbed media workspace, a route per tab.
- **Image upscaling**, single and batch.
- Batch images: clear completed batches from the queue, Adjust & Retry no longer
  multiplies the prompt by the quantity, prompt auto-detect no longer silently
  overrides steps (and has a toggle), Z-Image keeps its CFG-free defaults.
- The hidden SD-1.5 fallback is gone; img2img goes through the same guards as txt2img;
  large canvases no longer take the desktop down with them; the seed generator builds
  on CPU when CUDA cannot initialise.
- Documents: opt-in media gallery, fast streaming PDF viewing and an in-app DOCX viewer.

### Knowledge index

Vectors moved to pgvector, hybrid search is back, and ingest is roughly an order of
magnitude faster. Measured on the same machine and the same model, ingesting the same
corpus:

Measured on the same machine and the same model, ingesting the same corpus:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed cost per document | ~3.5 s | **0.02–0.07 s** |
| Characters embedded per chunk | ~2,230 | **~800** |
| A 151 KB document | 19.3 s | **6.1 s** |
| A 2 KB note | 9.3 s | **0.1 s** |

Four things account for most of it:

- **Every chunk was being embedded twice.** The text kept for citations was stored in
  metadata, and metadata is concatenated ahead of the chunk before embedding — so each
  chunk was sent to the model as both its text and its own metadata. Roughly half of all
  embedding work was duplication.
- **Chunks are sized by what is embedded**, not by what they carry. Chunk size is
  computed as `size - len(metadata)`, and that metadata is now excluded before splitting
  rather than after, so a document with a long path and tags no longer loses most of its
  chunk to text it was never going to embed.
- **The index no longer rewrites itself on every document.** It kept a JSON copy of every
  node and rewrote the whole file each time a document was added, so adding one document
  got slower as the corpus grew. That file is gone.
- **Garbage collection is amortised** rather than run twice per document. In a process
  holding the ML stack a full collection costs ~250 ms, which on a small file exceeded
  parsing, chunking and embedding combined.

Ingest cost is now flat in corpus size: one constant pair of coefficients predicts it
across a corpus growing from 0 to 703 documents and 36,000 chunks.

#### Keyword search moved into PostgreSQL

The keyword half of hybrid search now queries the full-text index PostgreSQL was already
maintaining, instead of an in-memory index rebuilt from a JSON file. Retrieval behaviour
is unchanged in shape — same fusion, same adaptive weighting, same reranking — but it no
longer depends on a file that had to be rewritten constantly, and it can filter by project
in SQL rather than after the fact.

Ranking is tuned for how people actually search. Rare words now decide a query: asking for
a specific name, identifier or error code puts the passage containing it first, instead of
letting common words in the rest of the question outvote it.

#### Also fixed in the index

- **Client, project and job metadata was never indexed.** Both metadata indexers passed
  their metadata in a form the indexing layer rejects, so every attempt failed and logged a
  message that read like a transient problem. They now work.
- **Uploads went through a lesser pipeline than everything else.** Files uploaded through
  the UI were read as plain text — a PDF or DOCX arrived as mojibake, markdown was never
  sectioned, and re-indexing appended a second copy instead of replacing the first.
- **Re-indexing generated text left the old copy behind.** A repository summary, client
  profile or extracted relationship stayed in the index after being regenerated, competing
  with the current version at query time.
- Re-indexing a document is no longer slower on a large corpus than a small one.
- Documents with no headings no longer explode into tens of thousands of fragments.
- Audio and video files are no longer fed to a text reader. They are not yet indexed;
  they are simply left alone until transcription lands.

- Deleting a document now actually removes it from the knowledge base; documents left
  PENDING by an interrupted run are requeued; auto-resume defers to an Ollama outage
  instead of condemning documents to it.
- Corpus sensemaking and a document navigation surface; index profiles (one registry,
  several derived projections); a staged document archive with filter, dedup and
  chronology; a `docling` dependency declared so PDF and Word files can be indexed at all.
- The knowledge tools work inside the MCP subprocess.

#### Upgrading the knowledge index

1. Back up if you want a fallback: `pg_dump` your database, and keep `data/docstore.json`
   until you are satisfied.
2. Upgrade and restart.
3. Re-index. The knowledge base rebuilds from your documents; the background catch-up job
   will work through them on its own, or drive it directly for a bulk rebuild.
4. `data/docstore.json` and `data/index_store.json` are no longer used and can be deleted
   once the rebuild finishes.

If you run PostgreSQL with default memory settings, `scripts/tune_postgres_for_rag.sh`
raises the two that matter for a vector index of any size. It prints what it would change
with `--dry-run` and needs root only to apply.

### Chat

- The floating chat keeps its thread across a refresh and names the page it is
  looking at; a distribution can declare which pages are chat surfaces.
- Pluggable per-turn context providers, and a knowledge-source registry on the RAG
  retrieval step; facts supplied by a provider are not treated as a web-search question.
- Markdown tables render as tables; a pasted description no longer triggers image
  generation; explicit "remember this" intents are captured.
- Rule bundles apply by name (`flask load-rules`), and Guaardvark ships its own voice as
  one; lesson bundles load into agent memories.
- The Ollama context window is bounded on every call that was leaving it unset.
- `list_documents` joins the core tools.

### Self-improvement and autoresearch

- Autoresearch rebuilt as a research system: live parameters, honest evals, bounded
  overnight runs with two-fidelity evaluation, a real kill switch.
- One overnight director schedules retrieval tuning, code tuning and Auto Improve.
- Proposals and research runs bind to the saved active model in the worker; a directed
  run only counts as a success when it staged a fix; bulk approve/reject/apply in the
  fixes dialog with progress and a result banner.

### Film Crew and training

- A `training_director` engine for procedure-guide videos: Kokoro or a cloned narrator,
  per-shot control over whether people appear, image-to-video that actually renders.
- Before Create, the LoRA trainer says whether the base model will be downloaded.

### Discord

- `/ask`, channel chat and voice all go through the unified chat engine, so the bot
  answers the way the UI does; the bot listens and talks in voice channels; `/video`
  delivers the finished clip to the channel.

### Privacy and security

- **Generation never leaves the machine**: backend model loads read local registry
  files only and never reach Hugging Face on their own; downloads happen only behind
  an explicit Install.
- ComfyUI binds to loopback and stops pinning host memory.
- Exact host matching and an explicit URL regex in the scout; an arithmetic-only
  calculator tool; batch-image names resolved through `safe_join`; cast-library deletes
  and other destructive media and GPU routes require localhost or the API key.
- Pillow floor raised to 12.3.0 and torch stopped silently undoing it;
  `socket.io-parser` overridden to 4.2.7; the Dependabot queue cleared again (av 18,
  safetensors 0.8, pydantic 2.13, psutil 7, typer 0.27, and the rest).
- CodeQL runs on every push; pull requests need a signed CLA; a pre-commit, commit-msg
  and pre-push guard keeps machine-specific content out of the repository.

### GPU and resources

- Resident models are reclaimable, so admission can free VRAM instead of refusing.
- Cross-process training leases; heartbeat leases under `flock`; eviction only when it
  helps; the GPU power limit is left alone by default.
- The job reaper tolerates ComfyUI probe blips and never steals a live worker's gate.
- The default image model is no longer refused on 32 GB machines, and a RAM-gate
  refusal now says "system RAM (not VRAM)".

### Install, platform and operations

- A curl-able bootstrap installer: `curl -fsSL https://guaardvark.com/install.sh | bash`.
- A platform layer (`scripts/platform/`) that says in one place what this machine can
  do, with macOS in CI; macOS honours the ComfyUI port override, finds a font, and names
  the reconciler that failed.
- Fresh Ubuntu 24.04 installs: Python dev headers before pip, the setuptools pin that
  made PyTorch uninstallable is gone, PyTorch wheels are staged before the working ones
  are removed, the Node major version is verified, the Postgres sudo gate no longer
  needs a tty, and bootstrap survives tmpfs `ENOSPC`, half-installed venvs and
  proxy-only boxes.
- `scripts/heal_backend_venv.sh` re-runs every reconciler the failure sentinel names,
  not only the venv ones (#41).
- Plugins ship disabled by default, with Ollama the exception; `plugin.local.json`
  per-install overrides survive updates; plugin config actually saves; restart waits out
  the cooldown instead of failing half-way.
- Backups dump only the database and install the app is using, and stop following
  plugin symlinks out of the project.
- Redis broker URL and Celery beat heal on stop/start; an abandoned `start.sh` is reaped
  without killing a new boot; the Intel e1000e NIC hang is detected and mitigated before
  heavy downloads.

### Interconnector and connections

- Stable, IP-independent node identity and a server-side client heartbeat daemon.
- Outbound connections with a credential store, publishing, and a publish approval queue.

### MCP and CLI

- `python -m backend.mcp install` writes the server entry into the configs of the agent
  clients it detects; `python -m backend.mcp doctor` self-tests the server and flags stale
  client configs. The server is on the 2.x MCP SDK.
- `/abort` for a wedged chat and stream timeouts that end one; offline recipe
  inspection commands (`recipes list / show / validate`).
- The CLI test suite runs in CI; the `release` workflow publishes to PyPI on tag and
  refuses a tag that disagrees with `VERSION` or a version PyPI already has.

### Desktop agent

- DOM-based verification fast path (fixes 60 s task-timeout blowouts); a window
  fast path for launch gates; the DOM element inventory feeds the decision prompt.
- Servo calibration restored with a live Gemma4 fit; truth injection and
  validation-gated calibration in the learning stack.
- Basic browser-navigation recipes and a YouTube-comment recipe.

### Documentation

- `docs/HARDWARE.md` — what runs CPU-only, on 8–12 GB, on the 16 GB target, and beyond.
- `AGENT_MENTAL_MODEL.md` — chat versus agent versus Swarm.
- The README repositioned around the whole platform, with the walkthrough series;
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` carries the comment and portability standards.
- The knowledge index documented, with the claims that were aspirational corrected.

### Known limitations

- Python 3.12 only; the ML wheels for 3.13/3.14 are still missing upstream.
- MiniMax H3 on a 16 GB card is correct but slow: it runs at the template's 20 steps
  with no distilled speed LoRA and no SageAttention path, and a tester measured about
